Store an object in space "space" under key "key" if and only if it does not
already exist.

The object will be create, and the attributes specified by \texttt{attrs} will
be set to their respective values.  Any attributes not specified by
\texttt{attrs} will be initialized to their default values.  The check is atomic
with the write, and is guaranteed to never overwrite an existing object.
