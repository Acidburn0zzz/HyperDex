Conditionally write the specified attributes to the object in space "space" under key "key".

The operation will modify the object if and only if all \texttt{checks} are true
for the latest version of the object.  This test is atomic with the write.  If
the object does not exist, the checks will fail.

The attributes specified by \texttt{attrs} will be overwritten with their
respective values.  Any attributes not specified by \texttt{attrs} will be
preserved.
